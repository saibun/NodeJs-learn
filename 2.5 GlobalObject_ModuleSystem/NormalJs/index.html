	<script type="text/javascript" src="./script3.js">
		//we link script3 where  variable c define and it is sum of a and b variable. so we can see this is possible only because of a and b both are save in window object.

		//it is a problematic sitution because any one can use same variable with different value, that why people prefer using let and const
		//but using let we may not re declere but we can reassign value so the problem is still on in this case
